  - Triggered by: "project context", "tech stack", "conventions", "architecture patterns"
  - Extracts tech stack, CI config, existing governance, and team signals
  - Generates Project Context Report for constitution authoring
- **syncing-claude-md** - Ensure CLAUDE.md mirrors constitution sections
  - Triggered by: "CLAUDE.md sync", "agent instructions", "propagate constitution"
  - Defines mandatory sync mapping between constitution and CLAUDE.md
  - Includes sync validation checklist and gap detection

## [0.2.6] - 2026-01-01

Fix skill description parsing for proper model-invoked triggering.

### humaninloop 0.2.6

#### Fixes
- **iterative-analysis skill** - Fixed YAML multi-line description format that prevented skill from triggering
  - Changed from multi-line YAML (`description: |`) to single-line format
  - Claude Code's YAML parser doesn't correctly handle multi-line descriptions
  - Skill now properly triggers on "brainstorm", "deep analysis", "let's think through", etc.

---

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-01

New iterative-analysis skill for progressive brainstorming.

### humaninloop 0.2.5

#### New Skills
- **iterative-analysis** - Progressive deep analysis through one-by-one questioning with recommendations
  - Triggered by: "brainstorm", "deep analysis", "let's think through", "analyze this with me"
  - Presents 2-3 options per question with clear recommendation and reasoning
  - Challenges disagreement to strengthen thinking
  - Concludes with structured synthesis document

### humaninloop-constitution 1.0.0

#### Milestone
- **First stable release** - The constitution plugin has reached feature parity with speckit and is now production-ready
- Stable API with semantic versioning guarantees going forward
- Tested and validated for all core constitution setup workflows

---

## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-01

Improved UX for empty input workaround - users can now re-enter input in the terminal.

### humaninloop 0.2.3

#### Fixes
- Improved empty-input detection UX: added explicit "Re-enter input" option
- When selected, command waits for user to type input in the terminal (better @ file reference support)
- "Continue without input" option remains for proceeding without input

### humaninloop-constitution 0.1.3

#### Fixes
- Same UX improvement for `setup` command

---

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-01

Workaround for Claude Code `@` file reference parsing bug affecting plugin command inputs.

### humaninloop 0.2.2

#### Fixes
- Added empty-input detection to all 6 commands (`specify`, `plan`, `tasks`, `analyze`, `checklist`, `implement`)
- When input is empty, commands now prompt user with AskUserQuestion to check if input was lost due to Claude Code's `@` parsing bug
- Users can re-enter input or continue without input

### humaninloop-constitution 0.1.2

#### Fixes
- Added empty-input detection to `setup` command with same workaround

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-01
