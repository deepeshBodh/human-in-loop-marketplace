## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-04

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Skills renamed to follow ADR-004 naming convention.

### humaninloop 0.5.0

#### Breaking Changes
- **Skills renamed** per ADR-004 category-based naming convention:
  - `analyzing-codebase` → `analysis-codebase`
  - `designing-api-contracts` → `patterns-api-contracts`
  - `iterative-analysis` → `analysis-iterative`
  - `making-technical-decisions` → `patterns-technical-decisions`
  - `modeling-domain-entities` → `patterns-entity-modeling`
  - `reviewing-plan-artifacts` → `validation-plan-artifacts`
  - `reviewing-specifications` → `analysis-specifications`

#### Skill Organization (ADR-004)
Skills now follow category-based naming:
- **authoring-*** : Writing patterns and templates (3 skills)
- **analysis-*** : Analytical capabilities (3 skills)
- **patterns-*** : Reusable domain knowledge (3 skills)
- **validation-*** : Check modules with scripts (1 skill)
- **syncing-*** : Synchronization utilities (1 skill)

#### Added
- **Validation scripts** for 4 additional skills (6/11 total now have scripts):
  - `analysis-codebase/scripts/detect-stack.sh` - Framework/stack detection
  - `patterns-api-contracts/scripts/validate-openapi.py` - OpenAPI validation
  - `patterns-entity-modeling/scripts/validate-model.py` - Data model validation
  - `validation-plan-artifacts/scripts/check-artifacts.py` - Artifact checks
- **Progressive disclosure** for 4 additional skills (10/11 total now have reference files)
- **Missing sections** added to `analysis-specifications` skill (Quality Checklist, Anti-Patterns)

#### Changed
- **Plan workflow refactored** to skill-augmented architecture
  - Removed: plan-research, plan-domain-model, plan-contract, plan-validator agents
  - Added: plan-architect agent with skill references
  - Check modules migrated to validation skills with scripts

#### Removed
- `analyzing-project-context` skill (merged into `analysis-codebase`)
- Plan workflow check-modules (replaced by validation skills)

#### Migration Guide
1. Update any custom references to skill names (see breaking changes above)
2. Skill invocation via `skills:` field in agents automatically uses new names
3. Scripts remain in same relative location: `skills/{name}/scripts/`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-03

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Constitution plugin merged into humaninloop.

### humaninloop 0.4.0

#### Breaking Changes
- **humaninloop-constitution merged into humaninloop** - All constitution functionality now part of main plugin
  - `/humaninloop-constitution:setup` is now `/humaninloop:setup`
  - No separate plugin installation required

#### Plugin Consolidation
- **New command**: `/humaninloop:setup` - Initialize project constitution (previously `/humaninloop-constitution:setup`)
- **New agent**: `principal-architect` - Senior technical leader for governance judgment
- **New skills**: `authoring-constitution`, `analyzing-project-context`, `syncing-claude-md`
- **New templates**: `constitution-template.md`, `constitution-scaffold-template.md`

#### Migration Guide
1. If you had `humaninloop-constitution` installed separately, uninstall it
2. Update to `humaninloop` 0.4.0
3. Use `/humaninloop:setup` instead of `/humaninloop-constitution:setup`
4. Existing constitutions at `.humaninloop/memory/constitution.md` remain valid

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-03

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Major architecture overhaul of the specify workflow.

### humaninloop 0.3.0

#### Breaking Changes
- **Specify workflow redesigned** - Replaced 6-agent Priority Loop architecture with streamlined 2-agent Supervisor pattern
  - Old architecture (removed): Scaffold Agent → Spec Writer → Checklist Context Analyzer → Checklist Writer → Gap Classifier → Spec Clarify
  - New architecture: Requirements Analyst ↔ Devil's Advocate (supervised loop)
- **Workflow artifacts changed** - New structure uses `scaffold.md`, `analyst-report.md`, `advocate-report.md` instead of `index.md`, `specify-context.md`, and checklist files
- **Constitution still required** - Pre-flight check remains; run `/humaninloop:setup` first

#### New Agents
- **requirements-analyst** - Senior analyst who transforms vague feature requests into precise specifications with user stories, functional requirements, and acceptance criteria
- **devils-advocate** - Adversarial reviewer who stress-tests specifications by finding gaps, challenging assumptions, and identifying edge cases

#### New Skill
- **reviewing-specifications** - Review specs to find gaps and generate product-focused clarifying questions (not technical implementation questions)

#### New Templates
- `scaffold-template.md` - Scaffold for supervisor-agent communication
- `analyst-report-template.md` - Report format for requirements analyst output
- `advocate-report-template.md` - Report format for devil's advocate output

#### Removed Agents
- `scaffold-agent.md` - Replaced by inline scaffolding in supervisor
- `spec-writer.md` - Replaced by requirements-analyst
- `spec-clarify.md` - Clarification now handled in supervisor loop
- `checklist-context-analyzer.md` - Checklist validation removed from specify
- `checklist-writer.md` - Checklist validation removed from specify
- `gap-classifier.md` - Gap classification now part of devil's advocate

#### Removed Templates
- `specify-context-template.md`
- `checklist-context-template.md`
- `workflow-index-template.md`
- `workflow-context-template.md`

#### Migration Guide
1. The `/humaninloop:checklist` command remains available for manual quality validation
2. Existing specs in `specs/` directory remain compatible
3. New specs will use the simpler `.workflow/` structure with scaffold and reports
4. No changes to `/humaninloop:plan`, `/humaninloop:tasks`, or other commands
