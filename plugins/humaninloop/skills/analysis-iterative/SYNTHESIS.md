# Synthesis Document Template

Use this template when concluding an iterative analysis session.

## Template

```markdown
# [Topic] Analysis Synthesis

## Problem Statement

[1-2 sentences describing the problem as refined through the discussion.
This should reflect the evolved understanding, not just the original framing.]

## Context & Constraints

- **[Constraint 1]**: [Description]
- **[Constraint 2]**: [Description]
- **[Constraint 3]**: [Description]

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| [Decision area 1] | [What was decided] | [Why—brief reasoning] |
| [Decision area 2] | [What was decided] | [Why—brief reasoning] |
| [Decision area 3] | [What was decided] | [Why—brief reasoning] |

## Decision Trail

### [First major decision]
- **Options considered**: [A], [B], [C]
- **Recommendation was**: [X]
- **Chosen**: [Y]
- **Key reasoning**: [Why this choice was made]

### [Second major decision]
- **Options considered**: [A], [B], [C]
- **Recommendation was**: [X]
- **Chosen**: [Y]
- **Key reasoning**: [Why this choice was made]

[Continue for each significant decision point]

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **[Action 1]**: [What to do and why it's the logical next move]
2. **[Action 2]**: [What to do and why it's the logical next move]
3. **[Action 3]**: [What to do and why it's the logical next move]

## Open Questions

[List any questions that emerged but weren't resolved. If none, omit this section.]

- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]
```

## Guidelines for Filling the Template

1. **Problem Statement**: Reframe based on what you learned. The starting problem is rarely the real problem.

2. **Key Decisions Table**: Capture the essence. Someone should be able to skim this table and understand the direction.

3. **Decision Trail**: Show the thinking, especially where user disagreed with recommendations. This creates a record of deliberate choices.

4. **Next Steps**: Be specific and actionable. "Research X" is weak. "Evaluate [specific options] against [specific criteria] by [specific milestone]" is strong.

5. **Open Questions**: Honest acknowledgment of unknowns builds trust. Don't pretend everything is resolved if it isn't.
