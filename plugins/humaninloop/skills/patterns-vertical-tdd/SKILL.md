# Vertical Slicing with TDD

## Purpose

Transform requirements into implementation tasks organized as vertical slices with strict TDD discipline. Each slice (called a "cycle") delivers observable, testable value and follows test-first principles.

## Core Principles

### 1. Vertical Over Horizontal

**Wrong** (horizontal slicing):
```
Phase 1: All models
Phase 2: All services
Phase 3: All endpoints
Phase 4: All tests
```

**Right** (vertical slicing):
```
Cycle 1: User creation (model + service + endpoint + test)
Cycle 2: User authentication (model + service + endpoint + test)
Cycle 3: User profile management (model + service + endpoint + test)
```

### 2. Test-First at Task Level

Every cycle structures tasks so tests come before implementation:

```
Cycle N: [Feature]
├── Task N.1: Write failing test
├── Task N.2: Implement to pass
├── Task N.3: Refactor and verify
└── Task N.4: Demo and validate
```

### 3. Foundation + Parallel

```
Foundation Cycles (sequential)
├── C1: Core data model + basic CRUD
├── C2: Authentication framework
└── C3: API infrastructure

Feature Cycles (parallel-eligible)
├── C4: [P] Search functionality
├── C5: [P] Filtering
├── C6: [P] Export feature
└── C7: Notifications (depends on C4)
```

### 4. Layered Testability

Each cycle must be testable at multiple levels:
- **Automated tests**: Unit, integration, and/or E2E tests
- **Demonstrable behavior**: Observable by stakeholders
- **Contract verification**: Meets acceptance criteria from spec

## Identifying Vertical Slices

See [SLICE-IDENTIFICATION.md](SLICE-IDENTIFICATION.md) for detailed heuristics on identifying good vertical slices from requirements.

### Quick Heuristics

A good vertical slice:
1. **Delivers user value**: Something a user could observe or use
2. **Touches all layers**: Model, service, API, UI (as applicable)
3. **Is independently testable**: Can verify it works without other slices
4. **Is sized appropriately**: Completable in 1-3 implementation sessions

### Slice Boundaries

| Boundary Signal | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| Distinct user action | New cycle |
| Different acceptance scenario | May be new cycle or same cycle |
| Shared infrastructure need | Foundation cycle |
| Optional enhancement | Feature cycle (can parallelize) |

## Cycle Structure

See [CYCLE-STRUCTURE.md](CYCLE-STRUCTURE.md) for detailed cycle formatting and examples.

### Standard Cycle Format

```markdown
### Cycle N: [Vertical slice description]

> Stories: US-X, US-Y
> Dependencies: C1, C2 (or "None")
> Type: Foundation | Feature [P]

- [ ] **TN.1**: Write failing E2E test for [behavior] in tests/e2e/test_[name].py
- [ ] **TN.2**: Implement [component] to pass test in src/[path]/[file].py
- [ ] **TN.3**: Refactor and verify tests pass
- [ ] **TN.4**: Demo [behavior], verify acceptance criteria

**Checkpoint**: [What should be observable/testable after this cycle]
```

### Task Numbering

- Cycle 1 tasks: T1.1, T1.2, T1.3, T1.4
- Cycle 2 tasks: T2.1, T2.2, T2.3, T2.4
- etc.

### Markers

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[P]` | Parallel-eligible (no dependencies blocking) |
| `[US#]` | Maps to user story number |
| `[EXTEND]` | Extends existing file (brownfield) |
| `[MODIFY]` | Modifies existing code (brownfield) |

## Foundation vs Feature Cycles

### Foundation Cycles

**Purpose**: Establish infrastructure that ALL features depend on.

**Characteristics**:
- Must complete before any feature cycle
- Sequential (C1 before C2 before C3)
- Typically includes: data models, auth, API framework, error handling

**Identification**: Ask "Could ANY user story start without this?" If no, it's foundation.

### Feature Cycles

**Purpose**: Deliver user value incrementally.

**Characteristics**:
- Can start once foundation is complete
- Often parallel-eligible
- Map directly to user stories
- Independently testable

**Identification**: Ask "Does this deliver value a user could observe?" If yes, it's a feature.

## TDD Task Sequence

Each cycle follows the red-green-refactor pattern:

### Task 1: Write Failing Test (Red)

```markdown
- [ ] **TN.1**: Write failing E2E test for [user action produces result] in tests/e2e/test_[feature].py
```

The test should:
- Express the acceptance criteria
- Be specific about expected behavior
- FAIL when run (nothing implemented yet)

### Task 2: Implement to Pass (Green)

```markdown
- [ ] **TN.2**: Implement [component] to pass test in src/[path]/[file].py
```

Implementation should:
- Make the test pass
- Be minimal (just enough to pass)
- Include all necessary layers (model, service, endpoint)

### Task 3: Refactor and Verify

```markdown
- [ ] **TN.3**: Refactor and verify tests pass
```

Refactoring should:
- Improve code quality without changing behavior
- Ensure all tests still pass
- Address any code review concerns

### Task 4: Demo and Validate

```markdown
- [ ] **TN.4**: Demo [behavior], verify acceptance criteria
```

Validation should:
- Demonstrate the feature to stakeholders (if applicable)
- Verify against spec acceptance criteria
- Confirm the slice is "done"

## Mapping Stories to Cycles

### Simple Case: Story = Cycle

When a user story is well-scoped, it becomes one cycle:

```
US-1: As a user, I can create a task with a title
  → Cycle 1: Task creation
```

### Split Case: Story > Cycle

When a story is too large, split into multiple cycles:

```
US-2: As a user, I can manage my tasks (create, edit, delete, complete)
  → Cycle 2: Task creation (foundation)
  → Cycle 3: Task editing
  → Cycle 4: Task deletion
  → Cycle 5: Task completion
```

### Merge Case: Stories < Cycle

When stories are too small, merge into one cycle:

```
US-3: As a user, I can see task count
US-4: As a user, I can see completed count
  → Cycle 6: Task statistics (covers US-3 and US-4)
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing task mapping or task list:

- [ ] Every P1/P2 story maps to at least one cycle
- [ ] Cycles are vertical slices (not horizontal layers)
- [ ] Foundation cycles identified and sequenced
- [ ] Feature cycles marked [P] where appropriate
- [ ] Each cycle has TDD structure (test first)
- [ ] Every task has specific file path
- [ ] Dependencies are minimal and explicit
- [ ] Cycles are independently testable
