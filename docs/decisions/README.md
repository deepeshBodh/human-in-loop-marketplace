# Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant technical decisions in the HumanInLoop Marketplace.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of an architectural choice. They provide a historical record of *why* the codebase is structured the way it is.

## ADR Index

| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| [001](./001-multi-agent-architecture.md) | Multi-Agent Architecture | Accepted |
| [002](./002-claude-code-native.md) | Claude Code Native Integration | Accepted |
| [003](./003-brownfield-first.md) | Brownfield-First Design | Accepted |
| [004](./004-skill-augmented-agents.md) | Skill-Augmented Agents Architecture | Proposed |
